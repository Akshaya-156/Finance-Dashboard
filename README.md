# Finance-Dashboard
## Overview
### Financial dashboards provide a quick and easy way to monitor an organizationâ€™s or personal financial performance in real-time. 
 ### A Power BI financial dashboard is a visual representation of financial data and key performance indicators (KPIs) created using Microsoft Power BI, a business analytics tool. It provides a comprehensive view of financial information, enabling users to monitor and analyze financial performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.
### Here I built a personal finance tracking dashboard.This project can be useful to anyone who wants to track personal expenses, income, and financial goals. There is an excel sheet containing the datasets that is used for tracking our expense savings and much more.

## Dataset
###  I have used a dummy dataset  from codebasics with minor changes to create the dashboard, which includes data on monthly expenses, income, savings and investments.

## Tools Used
### PowerBI-Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.
### Ms Excel- Ms Excel is a software program created by Microsoft that uses spreadsheets to organize numbers and data with formulas and functions.

## Features

### 1. We create a expense bar graph to track areas of expenses.
### 2. We also create a savings bargraph to analyze and invest the income in various types of methods like mutual fund fixed deposits etc.
### 3. The both bargraphs are connected to the respected line graph to monitor the detailed savings and expenses in each month of the corresponding year, thereby helping us to control our increasing expenses on certain months.
### 4. Then we will create a line graph by calculating the income last month and income change month per month and by using income change MOM% , saving% and expense% we create a line graph to analyze the percentage of changes in income, savings and expenses month per month ( in this dataset , it shows that when the income is increased there is increase in expenses and decrease in savings).
### 5. After analyzing the graph we create a new measure under income change MOM% i.e., savings_target .This is implemented on to the line graph to set a line targetting us to save certain percentage of our income , this is basically a straight line which helps us to acquire our target savings.
### 6. Income and Expenses are plotted as bar graph and Savings as line graph to visualize hoe savings is inceased or decreased along with the income and expense.
